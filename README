These are a collection of all the small scripts that I write on a daily basis.  
This README file will serve as a table of contents and give a breif description
of what these scripts do.

-- clean-vcp-db.py
	This script was written in because our team needed a quick way to delete
	tables with specific prefixes (usually created by Drupal). 

-- fix_songs.py
    This script fixes the names of music files if they ever get screwed up in
    some shape or form.  Currenlty works for mp3,m4a,wma and requires the 
    Mutagen python module/library. 

-- fix_perms.sh
	This script takes a a directory as an option and makes all files and 
	directories underneath group writeable.  Good if you are working with
	others on a file and want to quickly fix permissions in a large 
	directory of files.
